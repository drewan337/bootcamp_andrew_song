# Project Title: Portfolio Optimization Engine  
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)  

### Problem Statement  
Investment firms face significant challenges in optimizing portfolio allocations due to volatile markets, complex regulatory constraints, and conflicting risk-return objectives. This problem is critical because suboptimal asset allocation can lead to underperformance, regulatory penalties, or excessive risk exposure. A quantitative solution could enhance decision-making while ensuring compliance.

### Stakeholder & User  
- **Primary Stakeholder:** Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Hedge Fund XYZ  
- **End Users:** Portfolio managers (execute trades), Risk analysts (monitor exposures)  
- **Workflow Context:** Quarterly rebalancing cycle; must integrate with Bloomberg/Reuters APIs  

### Useful Answer & Decision  
**Type:** Predictive optimization model  
**Metrics:**  
- Target Sharpe ratio â‰¥ 2.0  
- VaR < 5% at 99% confidence  
**Artifact:** Python library generating compliant trade lists  

### Assumptions & Constraints  
- Data: Clean OHLCV for 500+ assets via API  
- Latency: < 4 hours post-market close  
- Compliance: SEC Rule 18f-4 compliant  
- Capacity: $10B AUM threshold  

### Known Unknowns / Risks  
1. Black-swan event impacts on correlation structures  
   *Mitigation:* Monthly stress-testing  
2. Behavioral biases in trade execution  
   *Mitigation:* Backtest with slippage models
