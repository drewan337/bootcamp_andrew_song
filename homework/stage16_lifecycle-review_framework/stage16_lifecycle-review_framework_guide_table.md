# Applied Financial Engineering â€” Framework Guide Template

| Lifecycle Stage | What You Did | Challenges | Solutions / Decisions | Future Improvements |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Problem Framing & Scoping** | Developed a ML strategy to predict Tesla stock price movements using technical indicators. Goal was binary classification (up/down next day) with risk-aware implementation. | Defining success metrics beyond accuracy. Balancing complexity with interpretability for stakeholders. | Used Sharpe Ratio, max drawdown, and win rate as additional success metrics. Focused on actionable insights rather than pure prediction accuracy. | Incorporate explicit business constraints and trading costs from the beginning. Define clearer stakeholder requirements upfront. |
| **2. Tooling Setup** | Configured Python environment with pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, flask. Set up GitHub repository with standardized folder structure. | Version conflicts between libraries. Ensuring reproducibility across different environments. | Used virtual environment and requirements.txt for dependency management. Standardized folder structure for easy navigation. | Implement Docker containerization for complete environment reproducibility. Add automated environment setup scripts. |
| **3. Python Fundamentals** | Applied data manipulation with pandas, ML modeling with sklearn, visualization with matplotlib, and API development with Flask. | Initial challenges with time series data handling and efficient DataFrame operations. | Studied pandas time series functionality and vectorized operations. Used sklearn pipelines for consistent data processing. | Deepen understanding of efficient memory management with large datasets. Practice more advanced Python patterns and optimization techniques. |
| **4. Data Acquisition / Ingestion** | Used preprocessed CSV data with technical indicators already calculated. Data included OHLC prices, volume, and derived features. | Missing values in early rows due to rolling calculations (SMA, volatility). Ensuring data quality and consistency. | Implemented forward-fill for technical indicators. Dropped remaining missing values after preprocessing. | Implement automated data validation checks. Add data quality metrics and monitoring for incoming data. |
| **5. Data Storage** | Stored data as CSV files in /data/ directory. Used pandas for data management and processing. | Limited scalability for very large datasets. Version control challenges with data files. | Kept data files separate from code. Used git-lfs for large files. Maintained clear data processing documentation. | Implement database storage (SQLite or PostgreSQL) for better scalability. Add data versioning system for tracking changes. |
| **6. Data Preprocessing** | Handled missing values, normalized features, calculated returns. Prepared data for ML modeling with proper train-test split. | Deciding on appropriate handling of missing values from rolling calculations. Feature scaling for time series data. | Used forward-fill for technical indicators, dropped remaining NAs. Applied StandardScaler with time-aware splitting to avoid lookahead bias. | Implement more sophisticated missing data imputation. Add automated data validation pipelines. |
| **7. Outlier Analysis** | Identified extreme price movements and volatility spikes. Analyzed whether outliers represented errors or market events. | Distinguishing between data errors and legitimate market events (e.g., earnings announcements). | Used statistical methods (IQR) to identify outliers. Contextual analysis to determine if outliers should be kept or treated. | Incorporate domain knowledge for outlier treatment. Implement automated anomaly detection with manual review process. |
| **8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Analyzed distributions, correlations, time series patterns. Visualized returns, volatility clusters, and feature relationships. | Identifying meaningful patterns in noisy financial data. Avoiding overinterpretation of random patterns. | Used multiple visualization techniques. Focused on economically meaningful relationships rather than statistical significance alone. | Add more sophisticated time series analysis (seasonality, structural breaks). Incorporate economic calendar events in analysis. |
| **9. Feature Engineering** | Created technical indicators: SMAs, returns, volatility measures, price-SMA ratios. Focused on economically meaningful features. | Avoiding overfitting with too many features. Ensuring features were computationally feasible. | Selected features based on financial theory and empirical testing. Used feature importance analysis to select most predictive features. | Incorporate alternative data sources. Implement automated feature selection with cross-validation. |
| **10. Modeling (Regression / Time Series / Classification)** | Implemented Random Forest classifier for binary prediction. Chosen for handling non-linear relationships and feature importance. | Addressing time series dependencies without leakage. Managing class imbalance in directional predictions. | Used time-based train-test split. Focused on probability outputs rather than hard classifications for better risk management. | Experiment with gradient boosting models. Implement probabilistic forecasting with uncertainty quantification. |
| **11. Evaluation & Risk Communication** | Used accuracy, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate. Communicated assumptions and limitations clearly. | Translating model metrics to business impact. Communicating uncertainty to non-technical stakeholders. | Created visualizations of performance metrics. Developed clear documentation of risks and assumptions. | Implement more sophisticated risk-adjusted metrics. Develop interactive risk simulation tools. |
| **12. Results Reporting, Delivery Design & Stakeholder Communication** | Created comprehensive stakeholder report with executive summary, key findings, and recommendations. | Balancing technical details with business relevance. Making complex modeling accessible to diverse audience. | Used clear visualizations and non-technical language. Structured report with actionable insights and next steps. | Develop interactive dashboards for deeper exploration. Create automated reporting pipelines. |
| **13. Productization** | Developed Flask API for predictions, modular code structure, and comprehensive documentation. | Ensuring code reliability and error handling. Making the system usable by other developers. | Implemented proper error handling and input validation. Created detailed documentation and usage examples. | Add model versioning and A/B testing framework. Implement continuous integration and testing. |
| **14. Deployment & Monitoring** |  Implement model performance monitoring and alerting. Set up automated retraining pipeline. |
| **15. Orchestration & System Design**  | Implement workflow orchestration with Airflow/Luigi. Design microservices architecture for scalability. |
| **16. Lifecycle Review & Reflection** | Completed full lifecycle review documenting each stage, challenges, and lessons learned. | Objectively assessing strengths and weaknesses across the entire project. | Used structured framework to ensure comprehensive reflection. Identified specific areas for improvement. | Implement continuous improvement process for future projects. Establish better documentation practices from the start. |

## Reflection

**Which stage was the most difficult for you, and why?**  
Modeling and Evaluation were most challenging due to the difficulty of achieving robust performance in noisy financial data and properly communicating the limitations and risks to stakeholders.

**Which stage was the most rewarding?**  
EDA was most rewarding as it used to data storage and preprocessing stage to create a model and analysis for the project goal while giving interesting insights in the particular stock and financial markets.

**How do the stages connect?**  
Early decisions about data preprocessing and feature engineering significantly constrained modeling options later. The choice of problem framing (binary classification) influenced all subsequent stages from data preparation to evaluation metrics.

**If you repeated this project, what would you do differently across the lifecycle?**  
I would incorporate more sophisticated time series validation techniques, implement better risk management from the beginning, and establish clearer success metrics aligned with business objectives rather than purely statistical measures.

**Which skills do you most want to strengthen before your next financial engineering project?**  
Deepen knowledge of time series econometrics, improve software engineering practices for production systems, and develop better communication skills for explaining complex models to non-technical stakeholders.
